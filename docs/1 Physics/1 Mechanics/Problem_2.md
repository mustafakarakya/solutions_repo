# Problem 2: Investigating the Dynamics of a Forced Damped Pendulum

## 1. Introduction

The forced damped pendulum is a rich example of how external driving and energy dissipation can lead to diverse behaviorsâ€”from simple periodic motion to resonance and chaos. In this report, we compare four main scenarios, as outlined below:

1. **Pure Pendulum (no damping, no forcing)**
2. **Damped Pendulum (damping $ \neq 0$, forcing $=0$)**
3. **Forced Pendulum (forcing $ \neq 0$, damping $=0$)**
4. **Forced Damped Pendulum (damping $ \neq 0$, forcing $ \neq 0$)**

We will produce time-domain plots (showing $\theta$ vs. $t$) and phase portraits (showing $\theta'$ vs. $\theta$). By systematically varying parameters such as the damping coefficient $b$, driving amplitude $A$, and driving frequency $\Omega$, we can explore transitions from regular to chaotic motion, resonance peaks, and other complex dynamics.

## 2. Theoretical Foundation

A forced damped pendulum can be described by the equation:

$$
\frac{d^2 \theta}{dt^2} + b \,\frac{d\theta}{dt} + \omega_0^2 \,\sin(\theta) = A \,\sin(\Omega t),
$$

where
- $\theta$ is the angular displacement,
- $b$ is the damping coefficient,
- $\omega_0$ is the natural frequency (e.g., $\sqrt{g/L}$ for a pendulum of length $L$),
- $A$ and $\Omega$ are the amplitude and frequency of the external driving force.

For small angles, using the approximation $\sin\theta \approx \theta$, the system behaves nearly harmonically. However, for larger angles or stronger forcing, nonlinearities and chaotic dynamics may emerge.

## 3. Implementation

Below you can see various simulations, and immediately beneath them is a comprehensive Python script. Each scenario outputs two types of plots (time series and phase portrait) as GIF animations:

1. **Pure Pendulum**  
2. **Damped Pendulum**  
3. **Forced Pendulum**  
4. **Forced Damped Pendulum**
