Introduction Projectile motion is a cornerstone of classical mechanics, illustrating how an object behaves under uniform gravitational acceleration after being launched with an initial velocity. Although the basic equations of projectile motion are straightforward, the problem offers a rich landscape of analysis. In this report, we investigate how the horizontal range depends on the angle of projection, exploring the theoretical foundation, computational implementation, and real-world applications. We also discuss how variations in initial conditions\u2014such as velocity, gravity, and launch height\u2014expand the family of solutions, giving rise to multiple trajectories that can model diverse physical phenomena. 2. Theoretical Foundation 2.1 Governing Equations The motion of a projectile in two-dimensional space \\((x, y)\\) can be derived from Newton\u2019s laws under constant gravitational acceleration \\(g\\) . Neglecting air resistance, the differential equations of motion are: \\[ \\frac{d^2 x}{dt^2} = 0, \\quad \\frac{d^2 y}{dt^2} = -g. \\] These simplify to: Horizontal Motion (no acceleration): $$ \\frac{d^2 x}{dt^2} = 0 \\quad \\Longrightarrow \\quad \\frac{dx}{dt} = v_0 \\cos(\\theta), \\quad x(t) = v_0 \\cos(\\theta)\\, t. $$ Vertical Motion (constant acceleration \\(-g\\) ): $$ \\frac{d^2 y}{dt^2} = -g \\quad \\Longrightarrow \\quad \\frac{dy}{dt} = v_0 \\sin(\\theta) - g t, \\quad y(t) = v_0 \\sin(\\theta)\\, t - \\tfrac{1}{2} g t^2. $$ Here, - \\(v_0\\) is the initial speed, - \\(\\theta\\) is the angle of projection (relative to the horizontal), - \\(x(t)\\) and \\(y(t)\\) are the horizontal and vertical positions as functions of time. 2.2 Time of Flight and Range For a projectile launched from ground level and returning to the same vertical level \\((y = 0)\\) , the time of flight \\(T\\) is obtained by solving \\(y(T) = 0\\) : \\[ y(T) = v_0 \\sin(\\theta)\\, T - \\tfrac{1}{2} g\\, T^2 = 0. \\] This yields two solutions: \\(T = 0\\) (initial launch) and \\[ T = \\frac{2\\,v_0 \\sin(\\theta)}{g}. \\] Substituting \\(T\\) into the expression for \\(x(t)\\) gives the range \\(R\\) : \\[ R = x(T) = v_0 \\cos(\\theta)\\,\\frac{2\\,v_0 \\sin(\\theta)}{g} = \\frac{v_0^2 \\sin(2\\theta)}{g}. \\] 2.3 Family of Solutions Varying parameters like \\(\\theta\\) , \\(v_0\\) , or \\(g\\) leads to a family of possible trajectories: Angle \\(\\theta\\) : Influences the shape of the trajectory. The maximum range is achieved when \\(\\sin(2\\theta) = 1 \\implies \\theta = 45^\\circ\\) . Initial Velocity \\(v_0\\) : The range depends quadratically on \\(v_0\\) . Doubling \\(v_0\\) quadruples the theoretical range. Gravitational Acceleration \\(g\\) : Lower \\(g\\) (e.g., on the Moon) increases the range; higher \\(g\\) (e.g., on Jupiter) reduces it. Initial Height \\(h\\) : If launched from a nonzero height, the time in the air changes, altering the total range and trajectory shape. 3. Analysis of the Range Range vs. Angle $$ R(\\theta) = \\frac{v_0^2}{g} \\,\\sin(2\\theta). $$ Maximum Range : \\(\\theta = 45^\\circ\\) . Symmetry : \\(\\sin(2\\theta)\\) has the same value for angles \\(\\theta\\) and \\((90^\\circ - \\theta)\\) . For example, \\(30^\\circ\\) and \\(60^\\circ\\) produce the same range (neglecting air resistance). Influence of Velocity Higher launch velocity shifts the entire range curve upward (since \\(v_0^2\\) appears in the numerator). Impact of Gravity A smaller \\(g\\) value extends the flight time and range; a larger \\(g\\) reduces both. 4.

Basketball: Adjusting angle and velocity to achieve precise arcs into the hoop. Engineering Cannons and Ballistics: Calculating the range for shells or projectiles under Earth\u2019s gravity.

Theoretical Foundation We start from the forced damped pendulum equation: $$ \\frac{d^2\\theta}{dt^2} + b\\,\\frac{d\\theta}{dt} + \\frac{g}{L}\\sin\\theta = A\\cos(\\omega_d\\,t) $$ 1.1 Small-Angle Approximation For small angles, we use the approximation $$ \\sin\\theta \\approx \\theta $$ which linearizes the equation to $$ \\frac{d^2\\theta}{dt^2} + b\\,\\frac{d\\theta}{dt} + \\frac{g}{L}\\theta = A\\cos(\\omega_d\\,t) $$ This differential equation has both homogeneous and particular solutions: Homogeneous Solution: The characteristic equation is $$ r^2 + b\\,r + \\frac{g}{L} = 0 $$ Depending on the value of \\(b\\) , the roots can be real or complex, leading to overdamped, critically damped, or underdamped responses. Particular Solution: For the forcing term $$ A\\cos(\\omega_d\\,t) $$ we try a solution of the form $$ \\theta_p(t) = C\\cos\\bigl(\\omega_d\\,t - \\varphi\\bigr) $$ This solution shows maximum amplitude near resonance, where $$ \\omega_d \\approx \\omega_0 = \\sqrt{\\frac{g}{L}}. $$ 1.2 Energy Considerations and Resonance The total energy of the pendulum is given by the sum of the kinetic and potential energies: $$ E(t) = \\frac{1}{2}m\\Bigl(L\\dot{\\theta}\\Bigr)^2 + mgL\\Bigl(1-\\cos\\theta\\Bigr) $$ Under resonance conditions (especially in undamped or weakly damped regimes), the driving force continuously feeds energy into the system, increasing the oscillation amplitude. In the damped scenario, energy dissipates over time, causing the amplitude to decay. In the forced pendulum, the external force introduces complex behaviors\u2014including periodic, quasiperiodic, and chaotic dynamics\u2014which will be examined in the following sections. 2. Analysis of Dynamics We analyze three main cases: Pure Pendulum: \\(b = 0\\) and \\(A = 0\\) The system exhibits undriven, periodic oscillations. Damped Pendulum: \\(b \\neq 0\\) and \\(A = 0\\) Due to energy loss from damping, the oscillation amplitude decays over time and the phase space trajectory spirals into the origin. Forced (Driven) Pendulum: In this case, the simulation is performed using \\(b = 0\\) and a nonzero driving amplitude \\(A\\) (e.g., \\(A = 1.0\\) ). The external forcing leads to complex behavior that may range from regular periodic motion to chaos. Phase diagrams and Poincar\u00e9 sections will illustrate these transitions. In addition, varying the parameters (damping coefficient \\(b\\) , driving amplitude \\(A\\) , and driving frequency \\(\\omega_d\\) ) systematically reveals transitions in the dynamics, including resonant amplification and chaotic regimes. Bifurcation diagrams will help visualize how changes in, for example, the driving amplitude \\(A\\) affect the system\u2019s attractors. 3. Practical Applications The forced damped pendulum model applies in various real-world scenarios, including: Energy Harvesting: Optimizing energy transfer from ambient vibrations. Suspension Bridges: Managing vibrations due to periodic loads. Oscillating Circuits (Driven RLC Circuits): Understanding resonance and damping in electrical analogues. Biomechanics: Modeling periodic motions such as human gait. 4. Implementation The following Python code implements the simulations for the three cases, generates time series, phase space diagrams, a Poincar\u00e9 section, and includes a bifurcation diagram by varying the driving amplitude \\(A\\) .

Discussion and Extensions Resonance and Energy Transfer: Under the small-angle approximation, the system is linear, and resonance occurs when the driving frequency aligns with the natural frequency, i.e., $$ \\omega_d \\approx \\sqrt{\\frac{g}{L}} $$ In this resonant condition, the driving force continuously feeds energy into the system, increasing the oscillation amplitude. Effect of Damping: In the damped scenario (e.g., \\(b = 0.5\\) ), energy dissipates over time, causing the oscillation amplitude to decay. The phase space diagram shows a spiral trajectory converging toward the origin. Forced Scenario and Chaos: In the forced pendulum case, the simulation is performed using \\(b = 0\\) with a nonzero driving amplitude (e.g., \\(A = 1.0\\) ). The time series, phase space diagram, and especially the Poincar\u00e9 section reveal how the system behaves under pure forcing conditions. Bifurcation Analysis: By systematically varying the driving amplitude \\(A\\) and plotting the corresponding Poincar\u00e9 section values (after removing transients), a bifurcation diagram is obtained. This diagram provides insight into how the system transitions from periodic to chaotic behavior as \\(A\\) is varied. Limitations and Extensions: - While the small-angle approximation ( \\(\\sin\\theta \\approx \\theta\\) ) simplifies the analytical treatment, the full nonlinear model using \\(\\sin\\theta\\) is employed in the simulations. - Extensions to the model can include nonlinear damping (e.g., air resistance), non-periodic driving forces, or the examination of other bifurcation parameters (such as the driving frequency \\(\\omega_d\\) ). - Further analysis via bifurcation diagrams assists in understanding the parameter regimes where the system transitions to chaos. 6. Conclusion This work investigates the dynamics of the forced damped pendulum through both analytical approximations and numerical simulations. By comparing the time series, phase space diagrams, Poincar\u00e9 sections, and a bifurcation diagram across various scenarios (pure, damped, and forced pendulums), the study illustrates the transition from regular harmonic motion to complex, potentially chaotic behavior. The model provides insights applicable to energy harvesting, vibration control in structures, driven oscillatory circuits, and many other real-world systems.

Conclusion"},{"location":"1%20Physics/2%20Gravity/Problem_1/","text":"Problem 1 Orbital Period and Orbital Radius: Applications of Kepler's Third Law 1. Introduction This document explores the fundamental principles and applications of Kepler's Third Law. According to the law, there is a linear relationship between the square of the orbital period and the cube of the orbital radius for a body in orbit. This law is crucial in analyzing the orbits of planets, moons, and other celestial objects. The work covers theoretical derivation, real-world examples (such as the Moon's orbit around the Earth and the orbits of planets in the Solar System), and computational verification using Python simulations. 2. Theoretical Background 2.1 Derivation of Kepler's Third Law for Circular Orbits For a circular orbit, a planet or satellite moves around a central mass (e.g., the Sun or the Earth) along a path with a constant radius. In such an orbit, the gravitational force supplies the necessary centripetal force for circular motion. Gravitational Force: [ F_{g} = \\frac{GMm}{r^2} ] \\(G\\) : Universal gravitational constant \\(M\\) : Mass of the central body \\(m\\) : Mass of the orbiting object \\(r\\) : Orbital radius Centripetal Force for Circular Motion: [ F_{c} = m \\frac{v^2}{r} ] \\(v\\) : Orbital speed of the object Equating the Forces: In a circular orbit the gravitational force provides the required centripetal force: [ \\frac{GMm}{r^2} = m \\frac{v^2}{r} ] Cancelling the mass \\(m\\) : [ v^2 = \\frac{GM}{r} ] Expressing the Orbital Period: The orbital period \\(T\\) is the time required to complete one full orbit. Given that the orbit's circumference is \\(2\\pi r\\) , we have: [ T = \\frac{2\\pi r}{v} ] Substituting the expression for \\(v\\) : [ T = \\frac{2\\pi r}{\\sqrt{GM/r}} = 2\\pi \\sqrt{\\frac{r^3}{GM}} ] Kepler's Third Law: Squaring both sides gives: [ T^2 = \\frac{4\\pi^2}{GM} \\, r^3 ] This result shows that the square of the orbital period is directly proportional to the cube of the orbital radius. The proportionality constant is \\(\\frac{4\\pi^2}{GM}\\) . 2.2 Conclusion and Interpretation The derived relationship indicates: - Fundamental Relation: [ T^2 \\propto r^3 ] - Although derived for circular orbits, this proportionality holds for elliptical orbits when the orbital radius is replaced by the semi-major axis. 3. Astrophysical Applications 3.1 Analysis of Planetary and Satellite Orbits Planetary Orbits: In the Solar System, the orbital periods and radii of the planets adhere to the relationship defined by Kepler's Third Law. For instance, the Earth's orbital radius is approximately \\(1.496 \\times 10^{11}\\) m and its orbital period is about \\(3.16 \\times 10^7\\) s, which are consistent with the theoretical formula. Moon\u2019s Orbit: The Moon\u2019s orbit around the Earth can be similarly analyzed. With an orbital radius of roughly 384,400 km and a period of about 27.3 days, these values enable calculations of other system properties and central masses using Kepler's relation. 3.2 Mass and Distance Calculations Calculating the Central Mass: If the orbital period and radius are known for a satellite or planet, the mass of the central body (e.g., the Sun) can be calculated by rearranging Kepler\u2019s law: [ M = \\frac{4\\pi^2 r^3}{G T^2} ] Spacecraft and Artificial Satellites: This law is also applicable in orbit determination for spacecraft and artificial satellites, providing critical insights for mission design and orbital maintenance. 4. Computational Model and Simulation Using Python The following Python scripts simulate both circular orbits and the linear relationship between \\(T^2\\) and \\(r^3\\) . 4.1 Circular Orbit Simulation In this section, we simulate the Earth\u2019s circular orbit around the Sun. # Import necessary libraries import numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt # Universal constants and parameters G = 6.67430e-11 # Universal gravitational constant (m^3 kg^-1 s^-2) M = 1.989e30 # Mass of the Sun (kg) r = 1.496e11 # Average distance of Earth from the Sun (m) # Earth's orbital speed v = np.sqrt(G * M / r) # Orbital period calculation T = 2 * np.pi * np.sqrt(r**3 / (G * M)) print(f\"Orbital Period (T): {T:.2e} s\") # Simulation parameters num_points = 1000 t = np.linspace(0, T, num_points) theta = 2 * np.pi * t / T # Angular position as a function of time # Orbit coordinates in the x-y plane x = r * np.cos(theta) y = r * np.sin(theta) # Plotting the circular orbit plt.figure(figsize=(6,6)) plt.plot(x, y, label=\"Circular Orbit\") plt.scatter(0, 0, color='orange', s=200, label=\"Sun\") plt.xlabel(\"x (m)\") plt.ylabel(\"y (m)\") plt.title(\"Circular Orbit Simulation\") plt.legend() plt.grid(True) plt.axis('equal') plt.show() 4.2 Graph of the Linear Relation between \\(T^2\\) and \\(r^3\\) The following code calculates orbital periods for different orbital radii and plots \\(T^2\\) against \\(r^3\\) to demonstrate the linear relationship. # Examples with different orbital radii (from 0.5 AU to 3 AU) r_vals = np.linspace(0.5, 3, 50) * 1.496e11 # Converting AU to meters (1 AU = 1.496e11 m) T_vals = 2 * np.pi * np.sqrt(r_vals**3 / (G * M)) # Calculate T^2 and r^3 values T_squared = T_vals**2 r_cubed = r_vals**3 # Plotting the graph plt.figure(figsize=(8,6)) plt.scatter(r_cubed, T_squared, color='blue', label=\"$T^2$ Values\") # Plot the theoretical linear relationship: T^2 = (4\u03c0^2/GM)*r^3 slope = 4 * np.pi**2 / (G * M) r_cubed_fit = np.linspace(min(r_cubed), max(r_cubed), 100) T_squared_fit = slope * r_cubed_fit plt.plot(r_cubed_fit, T_squared_fit, color='red', label=\"Theoretical Linear Relation\") plt.xlabel(\"$r^3$ (m$^3$)\") plt.ylabel(\"$T^2$ (s$^2$)\") plt.title(\"Linear Relation between $T^2$ and $r^3$\") plt.legend() plt.grid(True) plt.show() The codes above enable the following: - Circular Orbit Simulation: Visualizes the Earth's orbit around the Sun. - \\(T^2\\) vs. \\(r^3\\) Graph: Demonstrates that the computed orbital period values conform to the linear relationship predicted by theory. 5. Graphical Representations The Python code yields two main visualizations: - Orbit Simulation Graph: This graph displays the circular orbit along with the Sun at the center. - \\(T^2\\) vs. \\(r^3\\) Graph: This scatter plot shows the relationship between the computed values, aligning closely with the theoretical prediction \\(T^2 = \\frac{4\\pi^2}{GM} r^3\\) . These graphics confirm that Kepler\u2019s Third Law is both mathematically consistent and practically observable. 6. Extension to Elliptical Orbits In reality, many planets and satellites follow elliptical orbits rather than perfect circles. Kepler\u2019s Third Law still applies for elliptical orbits when the orbital radius is replaced by the semi-major axis (a) : \\[ T^2 = \\frac{4\\pi^2}{GM} a^3 \\] Here: - \\(a\\) : The semi-major axis of the elliptical orbit This extension is essential when analyzing slightly eccentric orbits. Although minor corrections might be necessary for very elliptical cases, the basic proportionality remains valid. 7. Conclusion In this solution: - Derivation: The gravitational and centripetal forces were equated to derive the relation \\(T^2 = \\frac{4\\pi^2}{GM} r^3\\) for circular orbits. - Astrophysical Applications: The formula is used to analyze planetary and satellite orbits and to calculate the masses of central objects (e.g., the Sun or Earth). - Simulation: Python simulations were conducted to visualize both the circular orbit and the linear relationship between \\(T^2\\) and \\(r^3\\) . - Extension to Elliptical Orbits: The solution extends to elliptical orbits using the semi-major axis, maintaining the validity of the relationship.","title":"Problem 1"},{"location":"1%20Physics/2%20Gravity/Problem_1/#problem-1","text":"","title":"Problem 1"},{"location":"1%20Physics/2%20Gravity/Problem_1/#orbital-period-and-orbital-radius-applications-of-keplers-third-law","text":"","title":"Orbital Period and Orbital Radius: Applications of Kepler's Third Law"},{"location":"1%20Physics/2%20Gravity/Problem_1/#1-introduction","text":"This document explores the fundamental principles and applications of Kepler's Third Law.
