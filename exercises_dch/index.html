<p><span style="font-size: 1.2em; font-weight: bold;">Investigating the Range as a Function of the Angle of Projection</span></p>
<h4 id="motivation">Motivation:</h4>
<p>Projectile motion, while seemingly simple, offers a rich playground for exploring fundamental principles of physics.

<h4 id="motivation_1">Motivation:</h4>
<p>The forced damped pendulum is a captivating example of a physical system with intricate behavior resulting from the interplay of damping, restoring forces, and external driving forces. By introducing both damping and external periodic forcing, the system demonstrates a transition from simple harmonic motion to a rich spectrum of dynamics, including resonance, chaos, and quasiperiodic behavior. These phenomena serve as a foundation for understanding complex real-world systems, such as driven oscillators, climate systems, and mechanical structures under periodic stress.</p>
<p>Adding forcing introduces new parameters, such as the amplitude and frequency of the external force, which significantly affect the pendulum's behavior. By systematically varying these parameters, a diverse class of solutions can be observed, including synchronized oscillations, chaotic motion, and resonance phenomena. These behaviors not only highlight fundamental physics principles but also provide insights into engineering applications such as energy harvesting, vibration isolation, and mechanical resonance.</p>

<h3 id="problem-1_2">Problem 1</h3>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.2em; font-weight: bold;">Interference Patterns on a water surface</span></p>
<h4 id="motivation_5">Motivation:</h4>
<p>Interference occurs when waves from different sources overlap, creating new patterns. On a water surface, this can be easily observed when ripples from different points meet, forming distinctive interference patterns. These patterns can show us how waves combine in different ways, either reinforcing each other or canceling out.</p>
<p>Studying these patterns helps us understand wave behavior in a simple, visual way. It also allows us to explore important concepts, like the relationship between wave phase and the effects of multiple sources. This task offers a hands-on approach to learning about wave interactions and their real-world applications, making it an interesting and engaging way to dive into wave physics.</p>
<h4 id="task_5">Task</h4>

<h3 id="problem-1_3">Problem 1</h3>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.2em; font-weight: bold;">Equivalent Resistance Using Graph Theory</span></p>
<h4 id="motivation_6">Motivation:</h4>
<p>Calculating equivalent resistance is a fundamental problem in electrical circuits, essential for understanding and designing efficient systems. While traditional methods involve iteratively applying series and parallel resistor rules, these approaches can become cumbersome for complex circuits with many components. Graph theory offers a powerful alternative, providing a structured and algorithmic way to analyze circuits.</p>
<p>By representing a circuit as a graph—where nodes correspond to junctions and edges represent resistors with weights equal to their resistance values—we can systematically simplify even the most intricate networks. This method not only streamlines calculations but also opens the door to automated analysis, making it particularly useful in modern applications like circuit simulation software, optimization problems, and network design.</p>
<p>Studying equivalent resistance through graph theory is valuable not only for its practical applications but also for the deeper insights it provides into the interplay between electrical and mathematical concepts. This approach highlights the versatility of graph theory, demonstrating its relevance across physics, engineering, and computer science.</p>
